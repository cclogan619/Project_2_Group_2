Our group consist of 4 group members as listed Ethan, Jaime, Juan and myself.
In the first few sessions meeting together it was discussed that the S and P 500 was going to be utilized to determined Buy and sale responds but not enough weighted data was available to give and accurate respond. 
Ethan and Jaime worked on the main coding with input from Juan on coding. Trading history questions from all. 
I developed Covid June 28 and was not able to attend any more of the zoom meetings an contribute a sufficent input. I went to the July 5 classtime and it was discussed a different source of data to be used could be put into the same code and machine learning data and come up with a better response. 

Ethan shared a website called Kaggle.com a place to learn data science and build a portfolio. So the data was used from Rossmann Store Sales. 
I told the group that I know I have been out of sick so I would be happy to contribute a Power Point. I sent this out yesterday with a name correction I fixed today. Upon the presentation Ethan used a different Power Point he had created, I do not have assist to this. 
I will attach my Power Point for grading purposes. 

Attach to my Git Hub for this project are files I could transfer from the Group GitHub and what files that would not I will attach. 

I am looking forward to the next modules. 

Sincerely 
Catherine Logan
